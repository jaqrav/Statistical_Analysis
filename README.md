The repository contains solutions for some of the problems presented during the course of Statistal Analysis of Experimental Data in the Department of Physics at Warsaw University.
All the documents are written in jupyter notebooks. 

1. Notebook error_propagation contains the solution for the following problem: given the dimensions of the cube $a$, $b$, and $c$ with their uncertainties, what is the uncertainty of its volume, area and total length of its edges? Are these entities correlated? Check the result with a  simulation.
